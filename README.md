# CoordinatePython

Line Class is the class that represents line between two points.(not available for now)

Point Class is the class that represents Point.

CartesianCoordinate Class is class for static methods:
- calculate_angle(point1: Point, point2: Point, point3: Point) 
  -> Calculates angle between lines point1-point3 and point2-point3. Returns angle value. Uses Law of Cosines
  
- calculate_distance_to_origin(point: Point) -> Calculates distance between origin and given point. Returns distance value.

- calculate_area(*args: Point) -> Calculates area of polygon that contains given points. Returns area value.

- calculate_triangle_area(point1: Point, point2: Point, point3: Point) -> Calculates area of triangle that created by given points
Returns area value. Uses Law of Cosines and Law of Sines.

- check_is_on_same_line(point1: Point, point2: Point, point3: Point) -> Checks are these points on same line. Returns bool value

- check_point_situation_to_line(point1: Point, point2: Point, point_to_check: Point) -> Checks situation of point to the line that is between point1 and point2. Returns SituationsForPointAndLine based on Points is on the line(.Contains), below the line(.Below), above the line(.Above).

- calculate_slope_two(point1: Point, point2: Point) -> Calculates slope of line that is between point1 and point2. Returns slope value.

- calculate_distance(point1: Point, point2: Point) -> Calculates distance between given points. Returns distance value. Uses Pythagorean Theorem.
